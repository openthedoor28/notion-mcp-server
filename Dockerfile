# Base image pinned to its multi-arch index digest (not the mutable `22-alpine`
# tag) so the registry can't swap the contents under us. Dependabot's docker
# ecosystem bumps this digest in a reviewed PR. Resolve a new one with:
#   docker buildx imagetools inspect node:22-alpine

# Per-architecture, locked npm cache. The CI build is multi-platform
# (linux/amd64 + linux/arm64) and runs both arches concurrently; a cache mount
# whose id defaults to its target is shared between them, so two parallel
# `npm ci` runs write the same content-addressed cacache blob and collide with
# `EEXIST: rename _cacache/tmp -> _cacache/content-v2`. Scoping the id per
# $TARGETARCH gives each arch its own cache, and sharing=locked serializes any
# remaining concurrent access.
